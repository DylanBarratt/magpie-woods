    <h2>The legend of Magpie Wood</h2>
   
    <h2>Story </h2>
    <p class="story-body">  
      Many many years ago, before the world was fully formed and the moon was still pink, Magpie Wood stood at the edge of two wonderful kingdoms – the Kingdom of Dendritica, ruled over by Quercus the great, the king, and the Kingdom of Arboria ruled over by Salix the gracious – Queen.  <br />
As is natural with these things, Quercus the Oak, and Salix the Willow, fell in love and decided to unite their Kingdoms into one, which they called Sylvania. <br />
 <br />
For a great many years they ruled Sylvania with kindness and with wisdom. <br />
They had three daughters, each one they called Betula, the Silver Birch - sometimes called the Ladies of the Woods by their friends ( And – coincidentally, when these daughters married they also had three daughters each!) <br />
 <br />
But the thing about Quercus and Salix and all their friends is that being trees they were rooted to wherever they stood.  <br />
 <br />
Now you might think this a disadvantage – not being able to move, But in point of fact, it’s a huge ADVANTAGE! <br />
 <br />
Trees don’t need to move, because their souls are free and live their lives in the form that we call birds. And birds can spread the seeds of the tree and drop them far away to spread tree babies that we call ‘saplings’ around the world to start new kingdoms. <br />
 <br />
Rooted to the ground, neither winds nor floods nor earthquakes can hurt trees and after all such disasters, they remain – firmly - in their kingdom and only when they outgrow their form and it gets too old and weak do they let it die naturally whilst their soul transfers to a sapling.  <br />
 <br />
The only disaster they fear is FIRE! For fire is unexpected and can strike down the strongest of all trees and destroy their saplings and everything else in the vicinity. <br />
 <br />
In the event of a fire of course, when the fire threatens, the bird simply leaves its tree to burn and moves to one of the larger saplings to live on. <br />
 <br />
So you see, you can never kill a tree – merely cause it to put its roots down somewhere else.
One day, in the land of Sylvania, where all the trees lived happily at peace, with their souls flying around them, a stranger came.  A messenger from a far distant land with a frightening tale to tell. <br />
 <br />
Garralus the Jay - for it was he - told of a land beyond the seas where a new threat to the survival of the woods had occurred and to warn Quercus of this threat. <br />
 <br />
Garralus described another inhabitant of this far off land who had come to the woods bringing their great enemy FIRE with him. “He walks on two legs”, like us, said Garralus, “but he can’t fly”. “Where we have wings, he has two pitiful thin branches that he calls ‘arms’, but he doesn’t need his beak to carry things – he uses these ‘arms’ and can lift things quite easily”. <br />
 <br />
“But we know of this creature”, said Quercus, “we call him MAN. We’ve lived with him for generations here. His means us no harm – we let him use our bodies for all sorts of things – he cuts our old tree form 
down to make what he calls timber and when he has left it for long enough for our sap, our ‘blood’, to dry out, he cuts it into shapes and makes things with it – things to live in he calls HOUSES and things to carry him on the water that he calls BOATS and all manner of things that are of use to him. And in return, he pulls off the nasty Hedera the Ivy, that tries to smother us and gets rid of the awful Sciurus – the Squirrel that feeds off our bark and steals our acorns”. <br />
 <br />
“He lives on the the ‘Oh’ that we and the Oceans breathe out and in return he gives us the CeeOh too that we need for life when he breathes out or he makes with his fire.” <br />
 <br />
“He lives at peace with our souls who are allowed to fly above him unhindered – in fact he will feed them in the hard times with scraps from his table and put water out for them to drink when the rivers and ponds are frozen. We regard him as friend. He does have fire, but he only uses our old, cast off branches to burn and never lets the fire come too near us”. <br />
 <br />
“Well”, said Garralus, “it is a different story in our land and many of my friends have perished because of man’s fire. He has come deep into our woods and deliberately started huge fires to destroy us and then he digs up the ground for crops or to let cattle graze or drills holes looking for something – we don’t know what – and we’re sure he’ll soon start here, so be warned because the fires are so huge and so fierce that we birds don’t all have a chance to escape”. <br />
 <br />
But Quercus dismissed Garralus saying he believed the stories were exaggerated and that his friends, man, would never do such a dreadful thing. <br />
 <br />
Aesculus the Chestnut, the Court Joker, said that Garralus was a bird with little brain and that he had flown too near the sun and got confused – and everyone laughed and got on with what they were doing. <br />
 <br />
And Ilex the Holly, the captain of the guard, and Fraxinus the Ash, his Sergeant, said that they could defend the Wood against all and every man (the whole court knew that this wasn’t possible but admired their bravery) <br />
 <br />
But some of the trees took notice of the stories.  <br />
 <br />
Cedrus the wise, the Cedar, told his soul Turdus the Blackbird, to fly to one of his saplings by the pond where fire would not go – he knew that fire was their deadliest enemy and that he needed to be near to water to have a chance of survival. <br />
 <br />
Fagus the Beech, another wise tree told his soul, Pica Pica the Magpie, to find Fringilla the Chaffinch, Corylus the Hazel’s soul and take their seed to  line the edges of the open field, away from the woods where fire would not reach and to tell Parus the Great Tit and Prunella the Dunnock (sometimes called ‘Hedge Sparrow’  by his friends) the souls of the two ladies-in-waiting Lonicera the Honeysuckle (sometimes called ‘Columbine’ by her friends) and Rosa the Dog Rose, to plant with him in the hedges. He urged Quercus to join him but Quercus said no - he did not believe the story that Garralus told and that his place was in the wood with Salix his gracious Queen. However, secretly he did fear the truth of the story but didn’t want to panic his people and he had already instructed his soul, Milvus the Red Kite, to find Aluada the Sky Lark and told him they must take their seed far away from the woods for safety. <br />
 <br />
Cornus the Dogwood, knew that he would be safe whatever happened because he had discovered a way to hide under the earth so that even if his body above the ground was removed, when the danger was past, he could rise again, He instructed his soul, Gallinula the Moorhen, that if this happened, he should find a pond and swim out into the centre of it and make a nest in the reeds until Cornus returned. <br />
 <br />
Fraxinus the Sargeant knew that he could not be destroyed since he had spread his seed already over the whole world and there was nowhere where his soul would not be – you will find his babies everywhere you look - as you will see Erithacus the Robin, his soul in every garden. <br />
 <br />
And so, Quercus the Oak, his Queen Salix the Willow and all their friends lived very happily for many suns 
with their souls fluttering around their heads <br />
 <br />
One day, when the sky was darker than usual and a strange wind blew rather forcefully through the branches, a messenger came through the air, Garralus the Jay - for it was of course him again, went straight to Quercus and settled in his branches.  <br />
 <br />
“Your Majesty” he said, “I have some urgent news of a disturbing nature”. <br />
 <br />
“Speak Garralus, tell me of your news.” <br />
 <br />
“The sky is dark towards the south”, said Garralus, “not with the clouds that sometimes colour the sky and bring us welcome rain, but with the smoke from a huge fire. Men out to the south are deliberately setting fire to the woods to clear the land”. <br />
 <br />
“But why would they do this?”  said Quercus <br />
 <br />
“It seems that man has more need of food and shelter and has to clear the woods to provide land to build his houses on and land to farm.” <br />
 <br />
“But what of our families whose homes they are stealing?” <br />
“They know nothing of our world” replied Garralus, “they don’t realise that everything is on this world for a reason and that we all balance each other so that if you take away one natural thing and replace it with something unnatural, the world will gradually tilt off of its bearings and everything will slide into chaos. They know nothing because they are arrogant – they think they know all, but in reality they know but a tiny tiny part of what makes this world which we share work so well”. <br />
 <br />
“Well” said Quercus, it’s just as well then that they are so puny. “However many of there are of them, they will never be able to fully destroy our world. Do you think that they know that when they cut us down or root us up that our souls simply move to another of our forms and our life goes on?” <br />
 <br />
“However, it would be a great pity if we were to have to leave this particular place – it’s an especial favourite of mine and Salix , and our daughters have all settled around us with their families nearby”. <br />
 <br />
Far far away to the south, man was struggling. <br />
 <br />
What he had started, he lacked the strength to end. As the wind grew so the fire grew and, despite man’s best efforts, it started to run away from him. <br />
 <br />
Man soon realised that fire could consume everything – including his own homes and farms and the woods he managed for his own use. <br />
 <br />
Desperately. He tried to fight it but the fire had got too big a hold and , eventually it reached the great wood where lived Quercus and his family and friends. <br />
 <br />
The smell of smoke in the sky hastened the work of transferring their souls to safety and pretty soon Salix, all the Betulas, Fraxinus and all the court had moved to safety beyond the edge of the wood. <br />
 <br />
Quercus was however determined to enjoy the corner of the great wood that we today know as Magpie Wood until the last possible moment and stayed In his arboreal form proud and magnificent gazing to the West as the fire raged toward him. Eventually, as the flames drew ever closer and he could smell his trunk beginning to burn, he departed his old form and moved to the new tree that had been made ready for him by Milvus the Red Kite, his soul. <br />
 <br />
But, before he moved, he decided that he loved the spot that he and Salix had graced for so long that he would leave a message for those who came after. <br />
 <br />
Using his powers he caused writing to engrave itself upon his trunk in the ancient Sylvanian language (which is, actually, a little bit like Latin!) <br />
 <br />
Gazing on the words of wisdom, he sighed and, finally satisfied that he had left a message that the fire might see and cause it to relent*, his soul left the wood and joined Salix and the court in safety . <br />
 <br />
*for fire, too is a natural object – men only claim to have discovered it but together with brother lightning, fire is one of the well-know ‘balancers’ of the world order. <br />
 <br />
When eventually the fire reached the corner of the Great Wood, it faltered. We shall never know if it saw the message engraved on the by now smouldering remains of Quercus’s old form or whether it just ran out of wind and could go no further. But stop it did and gradually it died away completely, leaving just the last small corner of the Great Wood, and the charred stump of the old form of the King, standing proud and upright where Quercus and Salix loved to stand and gaze out over their kingdom. <br />
 <br />
And when man finally came to that part of the wood that had just about survived the great fire he puzzled at the engraving, for only the wisest of the wise can ever read Sylvanian and understand it, and, not knowing why it had been written or by whom, but appreciating the beautiful view, left a seat nearby for man to sit quietly and enjoy the same vista that Quercus and his wife had enjoyed for so many centuries before. <br />
 <br />
And if you go there today, you’ll find it still – at the far west end of the Wood. It’s very very old now and starting to lean – Prunus the Wild Cherry has surreptitiously given it support – he didn’t want Quercus the Great to see it fallen over. <br />
 <br />
And if you sit quietly in that spot, you may well see, or at least hear, Milvus the Red Kite and Alouda. the Sky Lark.  For on nice days, Quercus loves to revisit the spot with Salix and together their souls fly above the trees– Milvus gloriously soaring into the sky in graceful majestic flight whilst Alouda hovers high above singing her heart out for the simple joy of everlasting life. <br />
 <br />
And, if, as you wonderingly run your fingers over the ancient letters, you look and listen even more closely and keep very very quiet, you may just see or hear the courtiers gathered round – Corvus the Crow, Garralus the Jay, Picus the Green Woodpecker, Parus the great Tit, and all their friends who come with Quercus and Salix to visit this beloved spot. <br />
 <br />
And if you look carefully very near to the wood, you’ll see the new trees that the King and Queen and their court have moved to – just on the edge, but far enough away from the fire to avoid the scorching of the flames. <br />
 <br />
Quercus stands with his younger brother to the north of Magpie Wood, no more than half a furlong away, looking towards his beloved Queen, Salix, who graces the edge of the green lawns between them where stand proudly some of his daughters and granddaughters – the Betulas. <br />
 <br />
Aesculus, the Court Joker (with his wife, Laurus, the Laurel) the best friend of the king and Queen, stands between them to keep them both amused and all around stand their courtiers whilst their souls fly happily above and sing to each other with the sheer exhilaration of living. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
The End. <br />
<br /> <br />
Translation of the legend (as close as we can make it in modern English):<br />
Take a rest here for a short while, because it's a special place to rest.
